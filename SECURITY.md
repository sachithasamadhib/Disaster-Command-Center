# Security Guidelines

## Environment Variables Security

### üîê Protecting Sensitive Information

This application uses environment variables to store sensitive configuration data, including Firebase credentials and API keys. Follow these guidelines to maintain security:

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files to version control**
   - The `.gitignore` file already excludes `.env` files
   - Always verify that `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`

2. **Use `.env.example` for documentation**
   - Keep `.env.example` updated with all required variables
   - Use placeholder values, never real credentials
   - Commit `.env.example` to provide setup guidance

3. **Validate environment on startup**
   - The application automatically validates required variables
   - Missing variables will prevent the application from starting
   - Check console output for validation messages

4. **Different environments, different files**
   - Use `.env.development` for development settings
   - Use `.env.production` for production settings
   - Use `.env.test` for testing environments

### üö® Security Warnings

1. **Never expose credentials in code**
   - Don't hardcode API keys, passwords, or tokens
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - Regularly rotate API keys and credentials

2. **Firebase Security Rules**
   - Configure proper Firebase security rules
   - Limit database access based on authentication
   - Monitor Firebase usage and access logs

3. **Electron Security**
   - Context isolation is enabled for security
   - Node integration is disabled in renderer process
   - IPC communication is secured through preload scripts

### üìã Required Environment Variables

```env
# Firebase Configuration (REQUIRED)
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project.firebasedatabase.app
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Optional Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
ENABLE_DEV_TOOLS=false
ALERT_THRESHOLD_TEMPERATURE=35
ALERT_THRESHOLD_PRESSURE=1000
ALERT_THRESHOLD_ACCELERATION=1.5
```

### üîç Environment Validation

The application performs startup validation to ensure all required variables are set:

- ‚úÖ **Valid Setup**: Application starts normally
- ‚ùå **Missing Variables**: Application exits with error message
- üí° **Guidance**: Clear instructions provided for missing variables

### üöÄ Deployment Security

For production deployment:

1. **Server Environment Variables**
   - Set environment variables on your server/hosting platform
   - Don't include `.env` files in production builds
   - Use platform-specific secret management

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Security**
   - Store secrets in CI/CD secret stores
   - Never log environment variables in build outputs
   - Use encrypted environment variables

3. **Monitoring and Auditing**
   - Monitor Firebase usage and access patterns
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity
   - Regularly review user access and permissions

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Tips

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Copy example file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit with your credentials
   nano .env
   
   # Validate setup
   npm run validate-env
   ```

2. **Team Collaboration**
   - Share `.env.example` with team members
   - Document any new environment variables
   - Use consistent variable naming conventions

3. **Debugging Environment Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check environment loading
   npm run validate-env
   
   # Start with verbose logging
   npm run start:dev
   ```

### üìû Security Incident Response

If credentials are accidentally exposed:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Rotate all exposed API keys immediately
   - Update Firebase security rules
   - Check access logs for unauthorized usage

2. **Prevention**
   - Review and update `.gitignore`
   - Scan codebase for hardcoded secrets
   - Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent exposure

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up Firebase monitoring alerts
   - Regularly audit user access and permissions
   - Monitor application logs for suspicious activity

**Remember: Security is everyone's responsibility. When in doubt, ask for help!**
